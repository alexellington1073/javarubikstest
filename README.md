## Java Rubiks Cube Model
Jave model of a rubiks cube. Started on a whim at the end of my first month at Tech Elevator. Made it a lot farther than I thought I would, and would've gone farther, but it was too difficult to read the cube with only an ugly text output. Was able to correctly turn any face, and properly represent its effect, at least as far as I could tell, ha ha.
